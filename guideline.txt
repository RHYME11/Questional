1. creat a new repository on the website;
2. git clone "website";
3. everytime create a new file under repository in terminal:
   3.1 git add filename;
   3.2 git commit -am "what you did" (record what you did)
   3.3 git push origin main (push those files to main)
   3.4 then you can refresh the website and check them 
   Eg:  (1)vim guideline.txt (must create a new file, if just change the existed file, ignore all steps mentioned up)
        (2)git add guideline.txt
        (3)git commit -am "add guideline.txt"
        (4)git push origin main
